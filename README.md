# Pepper at Sydney Startup Hub

This web system is built to conduct a social robotics experiment that used the [Pepper robot](https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper) in the [Sydney Startup Hub](https://sydneystartuphub.com/). The study was to explore how to design a registration and login process that responsibly collects necessary private information with a social robot while adhering to privacy regulations and providing inclusive services.

The hub visitors were free to approach the robot, which was programmed to greet and engage with the users detected at approximately 1.2 meters from the robot camera. When a user was detected and greeted by the robot, the user was invited to take part in the study. The user can complete the registration process on the robot or online website and decide to QR code or face ID to login with the robot.  The result of this experiment indicated that our social robot application was able to successfully maintain contextual integrity for the majority of participants.
